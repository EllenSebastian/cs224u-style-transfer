I am so pleased to see you both to adhere to with you the present day in something which will go down in the story just like the greatest demonstration for the purposes the liberty in the past history of our nation. Five score many years ago, a very great American, in whose symbolic the shadows we're stand the present day, the signing the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous this order came just like a very great beacon light of the hopes to millions of people of Negro a slave to whom had been seared in both the flames of withering the injustices. It came just like a joyous daybreak to end the very long night of their own captivity. But one the hundreds years when you grow up, james, both the Negro not yet is not free of charge. One the hundreds years when you grow up, james, the their lives of both the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the separation and the chains of the distinction. the manacles of the separation and both the manacles discrimination of any kind One the hundreds years when you grow up, james, the Negro living conditions in respect a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast the marine of material prosperity. a very lonely island of poverty issues in both the midst a vast the marine of the texts prosperity One hundred years when you grow up, james, the negro is still languished in both the corners of American the corporation, and finds himself an exile in his own the ground. And well, then we 've come in this place today to dramatize a quite disgraceful condition. In a sense we do have come to our nation's the deduction to the money a check. When the architects of our republic have written the just beautiful words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory please note to which every American was to fall heir. the Constitution and both the Declaration were signing a promissory please note all those American was with a view to 's dropping heir This please note was a have my word that all men, that's right, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." both the pursuit It is very obvious the present day that America has defaulted with respect this promissory note, as far just like her the people of the colour are in question. Instead of honoring the present sacred obligation, America has taking into account the Negro members of the public a bad check, a check which has come back marked "not enough funds." But we refuse to think that that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse with a view to think that that there are insufficient the means in the great vaults of the chance of this nation. And so, we do have come to cash this check, a check that will give the united states upon demand the riches of their liberty and the security of justice. We have, too, come to the present hallowed spot to remind ourselves America of the fierce a matter of urgency of Now said. This is no good time to commit themselves in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing dangerous drugs of gradualism. the luxury of air conditioning off or to take both the luxury take the tranquilizing dangerous drugs gradualism Now is the high time to are doing very real the promises of democracy said. Now is the high time to rise from the the night and desolate valley of the separation to the sunlit the route of racial justice. Now is the time to are living our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of the brothers. the high time to are living our nation Now is the high time to are doing the courts a reality for the whole of God shall be children. God shall be It would be life threatening for the nation to overlook the a matter of urgency of both the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating this fall of freedom and equality. the Negro shall be legitimate discontent will not pass all the way to there is an invigorating this fall of the liberty and equality Nineteen sixty-three is failed to an purpose, but a beginning said. And those who hope that the negro is required to blow off steam and will now be content will have a very rude awakening you know, if the nation the return in order to the business world just like usual. And right there will be neither rest time also not tranquility in America all the way to the the Negro is granted his citizenship the right. The whirlwinds of the uprising will go on like this to shake the foundations of our nation till the the bright day of justice is emerging. both the foundations our own nation both the bright day But right there is a little something that I must tell you to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into both the palace of the courts : In the processes that of gaining our rightful taking place, we must not be guilty about my work of wrongful deeds. Let the united states not are looking for to satisfy our the hunger for the purposes the freedoms from here drinking from both the cup of bitterness as well as hate speech. We are required forever conduct our struggle with respect the very high plane of the human dignity and discipline. We must not make it possible our creative the protests to degenerate into whether natural violence. Again and yet again, we must rise to the majestic the height of meeting whether natural force with soul force. The that wonderful once again militancy which has engulfed the Negro community level are required to not lead the united states in order to a the mistrust of the whole white people, for the purposes a great number of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence in this place the present day, have come with a view to realize that their the fate is tied in place with our the fate. And they have come to realize that their his liberty is inextricably bound to our freedom. We will be able to not walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march the front. 's working, we must make both the pledge We cannot their part back. There are the persons who are asking the devotees of civil the right, "When will you be complied with ?" We will be able to never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of the police force brutality. the the victims of both the victim the police force brutality We will be able to never be satisfied as a very long time as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. a very long time as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of both the highways We cannot be satisfied as a very long time as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. will be able to not be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We will be able to never be satisfied as long as our young children are stripped of their self-hood as well as robbed of their dignity from here the posters stating: "For Whites Only." the posters stating: "For Whites Only." We cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot cast their ballots and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote. cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot cast their ballots and a Negro in New York believes oh, nothing No, oh, no, we are not either satisfied, and we will not be satisfied all the way to the "justice rolls down like waters, and the virtue as though a mighty stream."
