I am so pleased to see you both to adhere to with you the present day in what will get out of here down in history just like the greatest the demo for the purposes the freedoms in the past history of our nation Five score many years ago a very great American in whose symbolic shadow we're stand the present day the signing the Emancipation Proclamation This momentous this order came just like a very great beacon light of the hopes to millions of people of Negro a slave to whom had been seared in both the flames of withering the injustices It came just like a joyous the dawn in order to a stop the very long night of their own captivity But one hundred years when you grow up, james the negro yet is not free One hundred years when you grow up, james the life of both the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the separation and the chains of discrimination against the manacles of the separation and both the manacles discrimination of any kind One the hundreds years when you grow up, james the Negro lives on a very lonely island of poverty issues in both the midst of a vast the marine of the texts prosperity One hundred years when you grow up, james the negro is still languished in both the corners of American the corporation, and finds himself an exile in his own the ground And well, then we ve come in this place today to dramatize a quite disgraceful condition In a the meaning we ve come to our nation the art capital to the money a check When the architects of our republic have written the just beautiful words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promissory please note to which every American was to fall heir the Constitution and both the Declaration a promissory please note to which all those American 's dropping heir This please note 've been a have my word that all men that's right black men as well as white men would be secured the unalienable Rights of Life Liberty as well as the pursuit of Happiness It is very obvious the present day that America has defaulted with respect this promissory note to the extent that her the people of the colour are in question Instead of honoring the present sacred obligation America has taking into account the Negro members of the public a very bad check a check which has come back marked too little funds But we're refuse with a view to think that that the the banks of the courts is bankrupt We refuse with a view to think that that there are insufficient the means in the great vaults of the chance of this nation And well, then we ve come to cash this check a check that will give the united states upon demand the riches of their liberty and the security of justice We have, too, come to the present hallowed spot in order to remind ourselves America of the fierce a matter of urgency of Now This is no good time to commit themselves in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing dangerous drugs of gradualism the luxury of air conditioning off or to take both the luxury take the tranquilizing dangerous drugs gradualism Now is the high time to are doing very real the promises of democratic politics Now is the high time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of the separation to the sunlit the route of racial justice the dark and desolate valley of the separation to the the night the separation racial the courts Now is the time to are living our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of the brothers the time to the lifts our nation from the high time to are living our nation racial the injustices the solid the stone Now is the high time to make the courts a the reality of the situation for all of God the art children It would be life threatening for the nation to overlook the urgency of both the moment both the nation overlook the the request for urgent procedure of the a matter of urgency This sweltering summer of the Negro the art legitimate discontent will not pass all the way to there is an invigorating this fall of the liberty and equality Nineteen sixty three is fails to an a stop but a beginning And those who the hopes that both the Negro is required to blow off steam and will now be their contents will have a very rude awakening you know, if both the nation returns to the business world as usual And right there will be neither rest time also not tranquility in America all the way to the the Negro is granted his citizenship the right The whirlwinds of the uprising will go on like this to shake the foundations of our nation till the the bright day of justice is emerging both the foundations our own nation both the bright day But right there is a little something fact that I must tell you to my country people who stand with respect the warm threshold which leads into the palace of the courts In the processes that of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds both the palace the courts Let the united states not are looking for to satisfy our the hunger for the purposes the liberty by drinking from both the cup of bitterness and hate speech We must forever and ever conduct our the fight on the very high plane of dignity and discipline We must not make it possible our creative protest to degenerate into whether natural violence Again and yet again we must rise to the majestic the height of meeting whether natural force with soul force The that wonderful new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence in this place today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny the that wonderful a the mistrust of the whole white people a great number evidenced from here their being present the present day have come with a view to realize that their the fate is tied in place with our the fate And they got have come with a view to realize that their their liberty is inextricably bound with a view to our their liberty We will be able to not walk alone will be able to not walk alone And just like we walk we must make both the pledge fact that we shall always march the front We cannot their part back will be able to not turn back There are those to whom are asking both the devotees of civil matters rights When will you be either satisfied We will be able to never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of the police force brutality the the victims of the unspeakable terrible things We will be able to never be satisfied as a very long time as our dead bodies very heavy with the punch himself out of travel will be able to failed to gain lodging in the motels of the highways as well as the hotels of the towns and cities We cannot be satisfied as a very long time as both the negro s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a most important one We will be able to never be satisfied as long as our young children are stripped of their self under-hood and robbed of their dignity from here the posters stating For Whites Only We cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot cast their ballots and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot cast their ballots and a Negro oh, nothing No no we are not complied with and we will not be satisfied all the way to the the courts rolls get down like the water and righteousness as though a mighty stream I 's me not unmindful that a little of you have come in this place out of very great trials as well as tribulations Some of you guys have come fresh from narrow the prison cells And a little of you have come from the fields where the hell your quest quest for the purposes the freedoms were gone you guys battered from here the the storm of persecution and staggered from here the high winds of the police force brutality You have been the former combatants of creative pain and suffering Continue with a view to the working with both the faith fact that unearned suffering is redemptive Go back to mississippi go back to alabama get out of here back to south carolina go back to georgia go back to louisiana go back to the slum formation and ghettos of our northern the city knowing that somehow this state of affairs mind if and will be changed Let the united states failed to wallow in both the valley of despa I the r position I tell you to you the present day my good friends And well, then even though we faced with the the challenges of these days and tomorrow I still have a dreaming this It that's a dreaming this very much rooted in the American must be dreaming I 've got a dreaming this that one day the present nation will rise and to follow instructions live out the true which means of its their beliefs We hold these truths in order to be self quite clear fact that all their male counterparts are created the equality I have a dreaming this that one day with respect the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of the brothers both the red hills of Georgia the children of the old slaves the their son sit down taken together at the the painting of the brothers I have a dreaming this that one the daytime the same both the state of Mississippi a state sweltering together with both the heat of the injustices sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of their liberty and justice I have a dream that my four little children will one day have lived in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their nature a dreaming this that my four little young children will one day have lived in a nation will not be judged from here both the color of their own skin the their contents I have a dream the present day I 've got a dreaming this that one the daytime on the floor in Alabama together with its vicious racists together with its the ruler having his lips dripping together with both the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in Alabama little black young boys and black the daughters will be able with a view to join the hand with very little white boys and white the daughters as sisters and brothers I have a dream the present day I 've got a dreaming this that one the daytime every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and greatness of the Lord shall be revealed and the whole flesh shall see it together and every hill and the mountains shall be have done the weak the rough places will be have done plain as well as the crooked places will be have done very straight and the glory of both the Lord shall be done revealed and the whole flesh shall look at it together This that's our the hopes and the present is the faith that I returning to the South together with With this faith we will power to hew out of here of both the mountain of the desperation a stone of the hopes With this faith we will power to transform both the jangling discords of our own nation into a very pretty symphony of the brothers With this faith we will power to the working together to let us pray together to the fight together to get out of here to the prison together to stand up for the purposes the liberty together knowing that we're will be done free one day
