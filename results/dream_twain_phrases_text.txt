I am very pleased to join together with you the present day in something which will go down in of historical just like the greatest demonstration for the purposes the liberty in the ancient history of our nation said. Five score several years ago, a very great American, in whose symbolic the shadows we're stand the present day, the signing the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous executive order came just like a really great beacon light of the hopes to millions of people of Negro slaves to whom had been seared in the the fires of withering the injustices. It came just like a joyous daybreak to end the very long night of their captivity said. But just one hundred years a little later, both the Negro still is doesn't free. One the hundreds years a little later, the their lives of both the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the separation and the chains of the distinction. the manacles of the separation and the manacles the distinction One the hundreds years a little later, the Negro living conditions on a a little lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material civilization prosperity. a a little lonely island of poverty reduction in both the midst a vast the ocean floor of the materials prosperity One hundred years later, the negro that's still languished in both the corners of American the corporation, and finds himself an exile in his own the ground. And well, then we 've come in this place today to dramatize a quite disgraceful condition. In feelings we've come to our nation's the capital city to the money a check. When the architects of our republic have written the just beautiful words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory point out to which every American was to fall heir. the Constitution and the Declaration were signing a promissory please note each individual American was with a view to 's dropping heir This point out was a have my word that all men, that's right, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." the its exercise It is clearly evident the present day that America has defaulted with respect this promissory note, as far just like her the people of the colour are in question. Instead of honoring the present sacred obligation, America has taking into account the Negro members of the public a bad check, a check which has come back marked "too little funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice that's bankrupt. We refuse with a view to 'm thinking that there are the insufficiency funds in the great vaults of the opportunities of this nation. And well, then, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give the united states upon the request the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have, too, come to the present hallowed spot to remind ourselves America of the fierce the request for urgent procedure of Now said. This is there's no time to commit themselves in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing medicinal products of gradualism. the luxury of cooling off or taking the luxury be taking the tranquilizing drug gradualism Now is the good time to be done very real the promises of democratic politics. Now is the good time to rise from the dark enough and desolate valley of the separation to the sunlit path of racial administration of justice. Now is the time to are living our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid the rocks of brotherhood. the enough time to the lifts our nation Now is the good time to be done the judge a reality for the whole of God's young children. God shall be It would be life threatening for the nation to overlook the the request for urgent procedure of the moment said. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass extended through there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. the Negro's legitimate the dissatisfaction will not pass extended through there is an invigorating this fall of the liberty and equality Nineteen sixty-three that's not an purpose, but a beginning said. And those people who hope that the negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a really rude awakening you know, if the nation the return with a view to the business community as always. And right there will be don't either rest also not tranquility in America extended through the Negro is granted his their nationality rights. The whirlwinds of the uprising 're going continue to shake the foundations of our nation extended through the bright day of administration of justice emerges. the foundations our own nation the bright the daytime But there that's a little something that I must said that to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of administration of justice : In the processes that of gaining our rightful taking place, we must not be guilty about my work of wrongful deeds. Let the united states not looking for to satisfy our the hunger for the purposes the liberty of here drinking from both the cup of bitterness as well as hatred said. We are required forever conduct our struggle with respect the very high plane of the human dignity and discipline. We must not make it possible our creative protest with a view to degenerate into physical violence said. Again and again, we are required to rise to the majestic the height of meeting whether natural force with soul force. The that wonderful once again militancy which has engulfed the Negro community level is required to not lead the united states with a view to a no confidence of the whole white people, for the purposes many people of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence over there the present day, have come down to realize fact that their the fate is tied up together with our the fate. And they have come to realize that their freedom that's inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walking around alone. And as we walking around, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. walking around, we must make the pledge We will be able to not turn back. There are the people who are asking the devotees of civil rights rights, "When will you be either satisfied ?" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro that's the victim of the unspeakable terrible things of police brutality. the the victims of the the victim's the police's brutality We possible to never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy together with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. long as our bodies, heavy together with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the the main roads We will be able to not be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. possible to not be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.
