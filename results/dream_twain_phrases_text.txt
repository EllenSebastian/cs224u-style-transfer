I am very pleased to join together with you the present day in what will 're going down in of historical as the most serious demonstration for the purposes the liberty in the ancient history of our own nation Five score several years ago a really great American in whose symbolic shadow we're stand the present day the signing the Emancipation Proclamation This momentous executive order came just like a really great beacon light of the hopes to millions of people of Negro slaves to whom had been seared in the the fires of withering the injustices It came just like a joyous the dawn with a view to a stop the very long night of their captivity But one hundred years after the negro still that's not free One hundred years after the life of both the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the separation and the chains of the distinction the manacles of the separation and the manacles the distinction One the hundreds years a little later the Negro lives on a a little lonely island of poverty reduction in the middle of a vast the ocean floor of the materials prosperity One hundred years after the negro is still languished in both the corners of American the corporation, and finds himself an exile in his own the ground And well, then we ve come in this place today to dramatize a quite disgraceful condition In feelings we ve come to our nation the art capital to the money a check When the architects of our republic have written the just beautiful words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promissory point out to which every American was to fall heir the Constitution and the Declaration a promissory point out to which each individual American 's dropping heir This please note 've been a have my word that all men that's right black men as well as white men would be secured the unalienable Rights of Life Liberty and the search for Happiness It is clearly evident the present day that America has defaulted with respect this promissory note to the extent that her the people of the colour are in question Instead of honoring the present sacred obligation America has taking into account the Negro members of the public a not well check a check which has come back marked insufficient the money But we're refuse with a view to 'm thinking that the the banks of administration of justice that's bankrupt We refuse with a view to 'm thinking that there are the insufficiency funds in the great vaults of the opportunities of this nation And well, then we ve come to cash this check a check that will give the united states upon the request the riches of freedom and the security of justice We have also come down to the present hallowed spot with a view to remind ourselves America of the fierce the request for urgent procedure of Now This is there's no time to commit themselves in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing medicinal products of gradualism the luxury of cooling off or taking the luxury be taking the tranquilizing drug gradualism Now is the good time to be done very real the promises of democratic politics Now is the good time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of the separation to the sunlit path of racial administration of justice the dark and desolate valley of the separation to the getting dark the separation racial administration of justice Now is the time to are living our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of the brothers the enough time to lift our nation from the enough time to the lifts our nation racial the injustices the solid the rocks Now is the good time to make the system of justice a the reality of the situation for the whole of God s children It would be life threatening for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment the nation overlook the the request for urgent procedure of the the request for urgent procedure This sweltering summer of the Negro the art legitimate discontent will not pass extended through there is an invigorating this fall of the liberty and equality Nineteen sixty's three that's not an a stop but a beginning And those people who hope that both the Negro is required to blow off steam and will now be their contents will have a really rude awakening you know, if the nation the statements to the business community as usual And right there will be don't either rest also not tranquility in America extended through the Negro is granted his their nationality rights The whirlwinds of the uprising 're going continue to shake the foundations of our nation extended through the bright day of administration of justice emerges the foundations our own nation the bright the daytime But there that's a little something fact that I is required to say to my country people to whom stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of administration of justice In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful the facts the palace administration of justice Let the united states not looking for to satisfy our the hunger for the purposes the liberty by drinking from both the cup of bitterness as well hatred We is required forever conduct our the fight on the high plane of the human dignity and discipline We is required to not allow our creative protest to degenerate into whether natural violence Again and again we are required to rise to the majestic the height of meeting whether natural force with soul force The that wonderful new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of the whole white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny the just wonderful a no confidence of the whole white people many people evidenced from here their being present the present day have come down to realize fact that their the fate is tied up together with our the fate And they've got have come down to realize fact that their their liberty is inextricably bound with a view to our their liberty We cannot walking around alone cannot walking around alone And as we walking around we must make the pledge fact that we shall always march the front We will be able to not turn back possible to not turn back There are those people who are asking both the devotees of civil matters rights When will you're be complied with We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro that's the victim of the unspeakable terrible things of police brutality the the victims of the unspeakable terrible things We possible to never be satisfied as a very long time as our the organs heavy together with the punch himself out of the travel expenses can doesn't gain lodging in the motels of the highways as well the hotels of the cities and towns We will be able to not be satisfied as long as both the negro s the basis mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one We possible to never be satisfied as long as our young children are stripped of their self under-hood and robbed of their dignity from here the posters stating For Whites Only We cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi will be able to not vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi will be able to not vote and a Negro oh, nothing No isn't it we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied extended through administration of justice rolls on the floor like the water and righteousness as though a mighty stream I am doesn't unmindful that a little of you have come in this place out of very great trials and tribulations Some of you're have come fresh from narrow the prison cells And some people of you have come from the fields where the hell your quest quest for the purposes the liberty left your side you're battered from here the the storm of persecution and staggered from here the the wind of the police's brutality You have been the veterans affairs of creative pain and suffering Continue with a view to the working with the has been that unearned suffering that's redemptive Go back to mississippi go down there back to alabama go back to south carolina go back to georgia go back to louisiana go back to the slum formation and ghettos of our the north cities knowing that somehow the present situation can and will be look different Let the united states isn't it wallow in both the valley of despa I r position I said that to you the present day my friendly countries And well, then even though we are faced with the
