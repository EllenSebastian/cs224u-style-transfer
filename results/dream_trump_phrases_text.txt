I am very happy to join with you're today in what's going get going down in history just like the most important demonstration for the purposes their liberty in both the history of our nation Five score many years ago a really great American in whose symbolic shadow we're get up today the signing the Emancipation Proclamation This momentous executive order came just like a really great beacon light of hope with a view to millions of people of Negro slaves who've had been seared in both the flames of withering the injustices It came just like a joyous the dawn with a view to a stop the a very long time night of their captivity But one hundred years a little later the negro still that's not free One hundred years a little later the life of both the Negro that's still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discriminating against the manacles of the separation and both the manacles the distinction One the hundreds years later the Negro people's lives on a a little lonely island of poverty reduction in the middle of a vast the ocean floor of the equipment prosperity One hundred years when you grow up, james the negro is still languished in both the corners of American the corporation, and finds himself an exile in his own the ground And well, then we ve come in this place today to dramatize a quite disgraceful condition In meaning we ve come to our nation s the deduction to the money a check When the architects of our republic have written the just beautiful words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promissory point out to which every American was to fall heir both the Constitution and the Declaration a promissory point out to which all those American the autumn heir This point out 've been a have my word that all men that's right black men as well just like white men would be guaranteed the unalienable Rights of Life Liberty and the its exercise of Happiness It that's obvious the present day that America has defaulted with respect this promissory note to the extent that her the people of the colour are in question Instead of honoring the present sacred obligation America has taking into account the Negro the people's a really bad check a check which has come back marked too little funds But we're refuse with a view to am thinking that the banking of the system of justice that's bankrupt We refuse with a view to am thinking that there are insufficient the money in the great vaults of the chance of this nation And well, then we ve come to cash this check a check that will give the united states upon the request the riches of freedom and the security of justice We have also've come to the present hallowed spot with a view to point out America of the fierce the request for urgent procedure of Now This is there's no time to get involved in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing dangerous drugs of gradualism the luxury of air conditioning off or to take both the luxury be taking the tranquilizing drug gradualism Now that's the time to be doing real the'm not promising anything of democratic politics Now that's the time to rise from the pretty bleak and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial administration of justice the pretty bleak and desolate valley of segregation to the pretty bleak the separation racial administration of justice Now is the time to are living our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of the brothers the time to are living our nation from the good time to the lifts our nation racial the injustices the solid the stone Now that's the time to be doing justice a the reality of the situation for the purposes all of God s children It would be life threatening for the nation to overlook the urgency of both the moment both the nation overlook the the request for urgent procedure of the the request for urgent procedure This sweltering summer of the Negro the art legitimate discontent will doesn't pass until there is an invigorating this fall of their liberty and equality Nineteen sixty's three that's not an a stop but a beginning And those people who hope that both the Negro you need to blow off steam and will right now be content will have a really rude awakening you know, if the nation the statements to the business community as usual And there's going be neither's staying also not tranquility in America extended through the Negro is granted his their nationality rights The whirlwinds of the uprising will keep going to shake the foundations of our nation all the way to the the bright day of administration of justice emerges the the foundation our nation both the bright day But right there is there's something fact that I 've got to say to our country people who stand on the warm threshold which is leading into the palace of administration of justice In the process of gaining our rightful place we must doesn't be guilty of wrongful deeds both the palace the system of justice Let the united states not're looking for to satisfy our the hunger for the purposes their liberty by drinking from both the cup of bitterness and hate speech We 've got to forever conduct our the fight on the very high plane of dignity and discipline We must not allow our creative are protesting to degenerate into whether natural violence Again and again we've got to rise to the majestic the height of meeting whether natural force with soul force The that wonderful new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for a great number of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny the that wonderful a the mistrust of all white people people a great number evidenced from here their being present the present day have're coming to realize fact that their the fate that's tied up with our the fate And they've got have're coming to realize fact that their their liberty that's inextricably bound to our their liberty We can doesn't walk alone can doesn't walk alone And as we walk we've got to make both the pledge that we're shall always march the front We can doesn't turn back can doesn't turn back There are those people who are asking both the devotees of civil the right When's going you be happy with We can never be happy with as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable terrible things of police brutality both the victim of the unspeakable terrible things We can never be happy with as a very long time as our dead bodies heavy together with the getting tired of travel will be able to n't gain lodging in the motels of the major roads and the hotels of both the cities We cannot be happy with as long as both the negro s basic mobility is from a least important ghetto to a larger one We can never be happy with as long as our young children are stripped of their own self hood and robbed of their dignity from here the posters stating For Whites Only We cannot be happy with as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote cannot be complied with as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro any provisions No no we are not happy with and we will not be happy with until the system of justice rolls get down like waters and the virtue just like a mighty stream I am doesn't unmindful that some people of you have come right there out of great the testing and tribulations Some of you guys have come fresh from narrow the prison cells And some people of you have come from the regions now where your quest quest for the purposes their liberty left your side you guys battered from here the the
