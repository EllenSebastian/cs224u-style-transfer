I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for their liberty in the history of our nation. Five score several years ago, a really great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand the present day, took place the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of people of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It have arrived as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years a little later, the Negro still that's not free. One hundred years a little later, the life of the Negro that's still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of the distinction. One hundred years a little later, the Negro living conditions on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years a little later, the Negro that's still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own the ground. And well, then we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In feelings we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic have written the magnificent words of the Constitution and both the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory point out to which every American was to's dropping heir. This point out was a promise that the whole men, that's right, black men as perfectly well as white men, would be secured the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the search for Happiness." It is clearly evident today that America has defaulted with respect this promissory note, to the extent that her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this pretty wild obligation, America has taking into account the Negro people a bad check, control which has come back marked "insufficient the money." But we refuse to think that that the bank of justice that's bankrupt. We refuse to think that that there are too little funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And well, then, we've come to the money this check, control that will give us upon the request the riches of freedom and the security of the judge. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce the request for urgent procedure of Now. This is no time to commit themselves in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing medicinal products of gradualism. Now that's the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now that's the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of the separation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now that's the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now that's the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be life threatening for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass extended through there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and level playing. Nineteen sixty-three that's not an end, but a beginning said. And those people who hope that the Negro is required to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business under the usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America extended through the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation extended through the bright day of justice emerges. But there that's something that I must said that to my people, who stand with respect the warm threshold which is leading into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty about my work of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for their liberty by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred said. We are required forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and disciplinary measures. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into whether natural violence. Again and here again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting whether natural force with soul force. The that wonderful new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of the whole white people, for many people of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence over there today, have come down to realize that their destiny that's tied up with our destiny. And they have come down to realize that their freedom that's inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walking around alone. And as we walking around, we are required to make the pledge fact that we shall always march ahead. We will be able to not turn back. There are those people who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be either satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro that's the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We will be able to never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy together with the fatigue of travel, can doesn't gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities said. We will be able to not be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We will be able to never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity from here signs stating: "For Whites Only." We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi will be able to not vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for the purposes which to cast their votes. No, isn't it, we are not either satisfied, and we will not be satisfied extended through "justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream's." I am doesn't unmindful that a little of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations said. Some of you have come fresh from narrow the prison cells. And some of you have come from the fields where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered from here the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative pain and suffering. Continue to work together with the faith that unearned suffering that's redemptive. Go back with a view to Mississippi, go down there back to Alabama, go down there back to South Carolina, go down there back to Georgia, go down there back to Louisiana, go down there back to the slums and ghettos of our northern towns and cities, in the knowledge that somehow this situation will be able to and will be look different. Let us not wallow in the valley of the desperation, I said that to you today, my friendly countries. And well, then even though we face the difficulties of today and the future, I still have a dreaming this. It is a dreaming this deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dreaming this fact that one day this nation will rise up and were living out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that the whole men are created equal." I have a dreaming this that one day with respect the red hills of Georgia, the children of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of the brothers. I have a dreaming this fact that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering together with the heat of injustice, sweltering together with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of their liberty and administration of justice. I have a dreaming this that my four little children will one day were living in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream the present day! I have a dreaming this fact that one day, on the floor in Alabama, together with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping together with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day that's right there in Alabama little black boys and black little girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white little girls as sisters and brothers for many years, right. I have a dream the present day! I have a dreaming this fact that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and the mountains shall be made low, the rough places will be have done plain, and the glory of the Lord's revealed and the whole flesh shall see it together. "2 This that's our hope, and this that's the faith that I go down there back to the South with. With this has been, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of the desperation a stone of hope. With this has been, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of the brothers. With this has been, we will be able to work together together, praying together, with a view to struggle together, to go to the prison together, to stand up for their liberty together, in the knowledge fact that we will be free one day.
